# Iowa Liquor Data Analysis with Hadoop
This is the repository for all the scripts/code we used to analyze the dataset.
[HERE](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy) is the link to the dataset that we used for our project. Due to the size of the dataset, you will have to download it from [Iowa's State Site](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy) in order to successfully use the scripts and any additional code that was used in this project.
